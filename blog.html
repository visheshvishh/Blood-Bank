                Knowing that you have the power to save a life and not using it is like wrapping a gift and not giving it.

                Blood donors are in true terms, “The real heroes”. 
                
               As a matter of fact, there is a constant need for a regular supply of blood throughout the world. 
               Blood is the most precious gift one human can give to another for it literally means giving someone “the gift of life”.
            There are many applications/ websites on your mobile or desktop, including UBlood, which centralize the blood donation campaign. The one that wants to donate blood can connect through this app  on their phone, and therefore the one who needs the blood can assess through application and obtain the right blood type. This is often the thing alike which is completed by UBlood. It’s one among the platform where the donors and therefore the receiver can connect 
            easily during <span class="read-more-text">    the tough time of COVID-19, and the one who is in need can get blood at a concise time and from the closest place possible.

Storing it at the right place at the proper temperature. 
Blood is typically stored within the refrigerator at 6 degrees for max 42 days. This wasn’t possible if the technology wasn’t advance, but thanks to the advancement of technology, blood can be stored for quite one month. Just in case of plasma, it’s frozen and may be stored for up to 1 year. For the treatment of COVID-19, generally, plasma is required because it contains the antibiotics.

Plasma Therapy
It’s one among the treatment which is employed for the treatment of COVID-19. As per the reports, no drug has been proven to be safe and effective to treat patients affected by COVID-19 but, people who’ve recovered from COVID-19 have antibodies — proteins the body uses to repel infections — to the disease in their blood. The blood from people who’ve recovered is named convalescent plasma. The liquid portion of the blood is known as plasma.

 4. Using of AI technology.

Artificial intelligence is one of the foremost vital aspects of today’s world. When the Coronavirus broke down, number of governments took the help of AI technology to recognize the people’s travel history and various other aspects that might be acknowledged and help to prevent the virus from spreading. This AI technology also can help for the blood donation camps, so there’s no danger of transferring blood of an infected person. 

5. Tissue Engineering

It could solve the whole issue of blood donation. Tissue engineering is flourishing with the constant and rapid development of digital technologies. Therefore the idea of liquid replacing the necessity for blood donation altogether isn’t a far-fetched thought. It’d be the direction into the longer term. The research the way to produce liquid means the look for finding ways the way to produce red blood cells.

 6. Simplifying the process

One of the rationales to not donating the blood is it takes time; it’s administered with a needle, and sometimes the nurse or the phlebotomist finds the acceptable vein only after a while. Innovations, like Veebots because it combines the newest in robotics and imaging technology to ultimately speed up the method of drawing blood or inserting IVs. just in case of blood tests, the robot reduces the entire process to a few minutes, and tests show that they will correctly identify the simplest vein with approximately 83% accuracy. It’s about nearly as good as an experienced human phlebotomist. I can imagine that blood-drawing robots are going to be lined up for the optimization of blood donation within the future adequately. 

7. Social media

For today’s world, social media plays a crucial platform to trend something in no time, and most of the people can react to that positively and at the earliest. What we will do is to require a blood donation campaign to social media to get leads and take the support of individuals. At the top, we will conclude that the first aim should be to save lots of lives and make awareness for blood and plasma donation.

            Saving lives by donating blood sometimes feels over-exaggeration, and India remains the world’s most substantial shortage of blood, with all states together battling an enormous shortfall of 41 million units and demand outstripping supply by over 400%, says the primary of its kind study published within the journal The Lancet. There are some myths about blood donation that some men think that blood donation will affect their masculinity negatively and consistent with Dr. Pragya Shukla, ‘Women feel they can’t donate blood, it makes their system weak. Generally, women have low hemoglobin, also one among the explanations they stand back from blood donations.’ Moreover, during this pandemic, there’s an enormous shortage of blood and plasma. How are you able to use technology for blood donation?

                            <span class="read-more-text">
                                Did you know? Statistics prove that every two seconds, there is a blood request made! Every two seconds! 

                                Blood cannot be obviously manufactured or produced outside of a human body and thus there is a higher need for the creation of awareness. 
                                
                                Generous blood donors are the only people who can replenish the blood supply of the world on a constant level because the blood, even after donation must be used within a certain period of time. <span class="dots"> ...</span> <span class="moreText">
                                
                                Statistics have also proven that more than 35% of people in the world are eligible for a donation of blood but the people who actually donate blood sum up to a mere 5%. 
                                
                                The entire crux of humanity is to be human in its true sense. Being human requires one to be selfless and compassionate. The most selfless act is the generous act of blood donation. 
                                
                                Also, science shows that 40% of the entire world’s population will need blood at least once in their lifetime. This means, donate blood because you too may need it one day. 
                                
                                There are various other needs to donate blood 
                                
                                1. To give back to society. 
                                We are always receiving from society and to be able to create balance and harmony for us and for our future generations, we need to give back. One way of giving back to society is through blood donation. Visit the nearest blood donation camp and do your part. It’s not an option, it is a necessity. 
                                
                                2. To get a mini-physical exam for free. 
                                Not to mention, an added benefit of donating blood is the free mini-physical examination of your blood pressure, your temperature, etc. You don’t really need to go through with blood donation for a physical examination but it is a cherry on the cake, isn’t it?
                                
                                3. To maintain a healthy heart and liver 
                                It is a proven fact that blood donation helps in the healthy maintenance of the human heart and liver for it balances out the iron overload in the body!
                                
                                4. To stimulate the production of blood cells

                                After the process of blood donation, the body of the donor works to replenish the blood cells and hence helps in the maintenance of good health! 
                                
                                
                                5. To help yourself in the  prevention of hemochromatosis 
                                Hemochromatosis is a health condition caused by the excess absorption of iron by the body. Regular blood donation would reduce the risk of this ailment and will help you stay healthy. 
                                
                                Plan your blood donation well in advance. Consult a doctor if necessary. On the day of your blood donation, stay hydrated and wear comfortable clothes. 
                                
                                Become a proud donor.

        All it takes is 350 ml blood to save a life. Whether it is red blood cells, platelets or other components; human blood is life giving. Ask anybody who has been through a challenging health crisis about the importance of blood. Be it a road accident, an emergency surgery, a sudden gastrointestinal bleed or other situations. We suddenly become aware of how critical blood donation is in such situations. If we do not get the blood in time we may succumb to the crisis. India has seen several instances where a patient died due to lack of access to life saving blood at the right time. Yes, timing is crucial when blood is required. Waiting can be fatal. 

        Human blood cannot be made artificially in a lab and the only source of blood is human donations. We depend on human generosity and kindness in coming forward to save lives with blood donations.    <span class="read-more-text">A large country like India is perennially short of blood. We have patients with chronic ailments like thalassemia, sickle cell anemia, hemophilia, cancers, other anemias, kidney disorders or liver diseases who depend on regular blood donations to carry on with life. Every step in life depends on the availability of timely life saving blood. A child/adult with thalassemia requires 2-4 units of blood each month for transfusion. Most blood banks across India depend on factories, companies and other midsize to large organizations where they arrange blood donation camps and ensure a steady supply of blood. This model worked fine so far.
        
                     
                            
Enter 2020 and the COVID19 crisis, every single aspect of life was disrupted including the corporate model of blood donations. Suddenly most blood banks in India ran dry as there were no more blood donation camps. Factories and companies closed during lockdown and employees started working from home. So how would blood donation camps be possible in a situation where a virus loomed large and presented the danger of spreading in communities especially at gatherings. State governments issued orders that group gatherings would not be permitted. This hit the concept of blood donation camps and in turn badly impacted a large chunk of patients depending on blood banks for chronic blood requirements. Our city Bangalore saw thalassemia patients left high and dry with nowhere to go for blood. Suddenly everyone was left alone to arrange for their own donors. What model would work in this situation?

In the virus crisis and lockdown, the concept of the “community” became stronger and more important for chronic patients seeking blood. People put out requests in apartment complexes and managed to organize a small number of donations ranging from 15-25 units. Small mercies to tide over the crisis. 

Suddenly it also hit us all that there must be a way of reaching out to donor databases and raising individual requests when needed. There must be a way of quickly accessing donor lists and arranging blood. We saw requests for blood in various whatsapp groups, facebook, twitter, instagram and other social media. But there must be an easier and more streamlined manner of requesting for blood. After all, putting requests on social media is a hit or miss. We don’t really know if there are donors around and if at all they will respond to the call for blood. 

What is a better way then? Most of us from the thalassemia community talked amongst ourselves that a digital app linked to a donor database would be the most helpful for individuals. A blood donation app would take our personal details and request for the particular blood group, number of donors required and connect us to the nearest available donors (along with details of when they last donated, their current availability and willingness to come forward). We would also have the option of organizing a cab service for such donors. This would take care of even emergency requirements for immediate blood donations. The app would give the option of storing personal details of chronic patients like those with thalassemia requiring regular blood transfusions. This can save the effort of entering details each time we make a request. 

Clearly, our city Bangalore is in need of such an app to address our blood needs and do a direct connect to donors. This will address a large part of the problem and ensure that patients do not end up running from pillar to post for blood needs. This will also make it easier for donors to actually see where their blood goes and who it helps. An app is also a good way to maintain confidentiality of those requiring blood as well as those donating blood. An important point to consider in data privacy. 

One may raise the point that an app will not serve the poorest sections of society who have no access to smartphones or internet required for using digital tools. Understandably the digital divide is a harsh reality and to take care of this section of the population we need other options like phone-in requests or on-the-ground support. 

A 360-degree solution is needed to address the blood crisis in India during such challenging times where people fear even going out of their homes. Yet we have seen the heroism of blood donors who have donated in the worst of times. Leaving aside fears and risks, such warriors came forward to save lives. Words are insufficient to thank the blood heroes and heroines who donated fearlessly. 

The thalassemia community in Bangalore rallied around the COVID19 crisis and raised the issue of blood crisis in mainstream and social media. We used various options to deal with our blood transfusion requirements ranging from organizing small community camps, using online donor databases and calling individual donors, tapping into our own family and friends network and of course social media requests. What will make our lives easier in future is a verified app for those who use smartphones and the internet with validated donor databases. So that every blood transfusion is not just a needle prick but a mental hassle with organizing donors and running around. 

We look forward to supporting any such venture that will create digital tools to solve our blood woes which we foresee will last for at least the next year or two or so until COVID19 exits the country.

        World Blood Donor Day is celebrated on the 14 June every year. It is being distinguished to raise awareness about saving lives by blood donations. Each year millions of people all over the world decide to donate blood and plasma; this is the reason why it has been called the World Blood Donor Day.



There are a number of reasons why people take part in blood donation events like World Blood Donor Day every year. First, it is a way to save the lives of many people who are affected by diseases and conditions. In addition, by donating blood, these patients will be able to continue their medical treatment, which will give them better chances to survive the disease. However, this does not mean that they have to give up their drugs or medication - they can always choose to withdraw from them if they are uncomfortable about
   <span class="read-more-text"> taking them. History of World Blood Donor Day
    In 2004 World Blood Donor Day was first distinguished by the WHO. In the 58th World Health Assembly, 2005 it was declared as an annual global event to raise awareness of the importance of blood donation.
    
    
    
    Birthday of Karl Landsteiner is celebrated as World Blood Donor day, he was Austrian American immunologist, pathologist and a Nobel Prize winner in 1930 because of his development and discovery of ABO blood group system and modern blood transfusion.
    
    Significance of World Blood Donor Day
    World Blood Donor Day was founded to bring together people from different parts of the world who have the same interest - saving lives of men and women affected by diseases such as Coronavirus, HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis etc.
    
    
    
    ﻿On this day, volunteers, including men and women, from different countries of the globe, donate blood, and plasma to help people in need. If you are one of those who want to lend a hand and can't find the time to participate in blood transfusions and plasma donation, then you can make up for it by sharing your own blood. This is the easiest way to help out other people during World Blood Donor Day.
    
    Importance of Blood Donation
    The importance of donating blood is not only to save the lives of thousands of people who are deprived of life, but also to save the lives of many more who are affected by various diseases and help them to fight numerous illnesses. 
    
    
    
    It has also been seen that when people have donated their blood, they have gained many health benefits. Most of the people who donate their blood tend to recover fast from their diseases and even live a longer life, it also helps in weight loss, in maintaining healthy liver and iron level, reducing risk of heart attack and cancer

    Blood donation not only saves lives but also has key benefits that we are unaware of.  It balances the level of iron in the body, regulates blood flow, reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease and stroke, triggers production of new blood cells and helps in weight loss. Safe blood saves lives. Blood is needed by women with complications during pregnancy and childbirth, children with severe anaemia, often resulting from malaria or malnutrition, accident victims and surgical and cancer patients.

    There is a constant need for a regular supply of blood because it can be stored only for a limited period of time before use. Regular blood donation by a sufficient number of healthy people is needed to ensure  <span class="read-more-text"> that blood will always be available whenever and wherever it is needed.
    
    Blood is the most precious gift that anyone can give to another person – the gift of life. A decision to donate your blood can save a life, or even several if your blood is separated into its components – red cells, platelets and plasma – which can be used individually for patients with specific conditions </span>
